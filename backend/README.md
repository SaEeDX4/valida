# Valida backend

Node.js + Express REST API for the Valida platform.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Milestone | **B1 — Backend Runtime & Configuration** |
| Runtime | Node.js `>=24.0.0 <25.0.0`, ESM |
| API base path | `/api/v1` |
| Database | **Not connected** — Milestone B2 |

B1 delivers the production-oriented Express foundation: validated
configuration, security headers, CORS, request correlation, structured
logging, rate limiting, the canonical error model, health and readiness, and
graceful shutdown.

It delivers **no business functionality**. There are no jobs, no applications,
no uploads and no email. `/api/v1/health/ready` correctly answers **503**,
because three of the four dependencies canonical readiness requires do not
exist yet.

---

## Install

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
```

Copy the example environment file and adjust it if needed:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

`.env` is git-ignored and must never be committed. The runtime loads it
natively through `--env-file-if-exists` (Node 24), so there is no `dotenv`
dependency.

## Run

```powershell
npm start     # start the server
npm run dev   # start with --watch for local development
```

Default: <http://localhost:4000>

```powershell
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/health
curl -i http://localhost:4000/api/v1/health/ready
```

## Test

```powershell
npm test          # Vitest, single run
npm run test:watch
npm run verify:b1 # tests + npm audit
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | no | `development` | `development` \| `test` \| `production` |
| `APP_ENV` | no | `local` | `local` \| `review` \| `production` |
| `PORT` | no | `4000` | 1–65535. `0` is rejected: it would bind a random port |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | `fatal`…`trace`, or `silent` |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | **yes in production** | localhost 5173 + 4173 | Comma-separated exact origins. `*` is rejected |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | no | `false` | `false`, or the number of trusted proxy hops (1–10) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | no | `60000` | Rate-limit window |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | no | `120` | Requests allowed per window per client IP |

Configuration is validated once at startup with Zod. **Invalid or missing
production-critical configuration stops the process** rather than serving
traffic in a half-configured state. Error messages name the offending variable
and never print its value.

Variables recorded in `.env.example` as *future* — `MONGODB_URI`,
`RESUME_STORAGE_*`, `TRANSACTIONAL_EMAIL_*`, `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — are
deliberately **not** read or required. Requiring a variable nothing consumes
would imply the capability exists.

### `TRUST_PROXY` deserves care

It defaults to `false`. Trusting `X-Forwarded-For` when no proxy sets it lets
any client spoof its IP and bypass the rate limit completely. The correct
production value depends on how many proxies actually sit in front of the app
and must be confirmed per deployment.

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/v1/health` — liveness

Is the process alive and serving HTTP? No authentication, no database, no
dependency of any kind. Returns `200` while the process is running.

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "status": "ok" }, "meta": { "requestId": "…" } }
```

A liveness probe must not depend on the database — one that did would restart a
healthy instance during a database blip.

### `GET /api/v1/health/ready` — readiness

Should this instance receive traffic? `200` only when **every** required
dependency is ready:

| Dependency | Owner | State at B1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `configuration` | B1 | ready |
| `database` | B2 | not implemented |
| `resumeStorage` | B4 | not implemented |
| `notifications` | B6 | not implemented |

So a B1 runtime answers:

```
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE", … }, "meta": { … } }
```

That is correct, not a bug. The public body never says *which* dependency is
missing — that would tell an unauthenticated caller which part of the
infrastructure is down. The detail goes to the internal log.

---

## Response envelopes

Success:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": {}, "meta": { "requestId": "…" } }
```

Error:

```json
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Safe message." }, "meta": { "requestId": "…" } }
```

| Code | Status | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `API_ROUTE_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Unknown route. Always JSON, never Express HTML |
| `MALFORMED_REQUEST` | 400 | Body is not valid JSON |
| `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` | 413 | JSON body over 100 KB |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | General rate limit exceeded |
| `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | Readiness dependencies not ready |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected failure |

A `500` never contains a stack, file path, environment variable, connection
string, credential or driver message — **and neither does the log**. Logs
record the requestId plus a bounded classification (error type, status,
canonical code) taken from fixed tables, never the error's own `message`,
`stack`, `cause`, `name` or `code`. The requestId appears in both the log and
the client's response, which is how a user's report is correlated.

## Request correlation

Every request gets a high-entropy id, returned as `X-Request-ID` and repeated
in `meta.requestId` and every log line. An inbound `X-Request-ID` is reused
only if it matches `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{8,128}$` — otherwise a fresh UUID is
generated, so a caller cannot forge log entries with newlines or bloat logs
with a huge value.

## Logging

Structured Pino, JSON in production. Each request logs method, path, status,
duration and request id.

Bodies are **never** logged — a resume, a name and an email pass through them.
Query strings are stripped, so an accidental `?email=…` cannot reach a log
file. Authorization, cookie and API-key headers are redacted defensively.

Error text is never logged either. `message`, `stack` and `cause` carry
connection strings, credentials, filesystem paths and request-body fragments,
and `name`/`code` are ordinary writable properties that a library could set to
anything — so every logged value comes from a fixed table instead of from the
error object. Startup failures follow the same rule: a configuration error is
printed in full because its text is built only from a value-free rule table,
while any other startup exception prints its classification only.

## Security

- `X-Powered-By` disabled
- Helmet: CSP `default-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `nosniff`,
  `no-referrer`, HSTS, same-origin resource policy
- CORS from an explicit allowlist; no wildcard, no credentials
- 100 KB JSON body limit
- General rate limit: 120 requests / 60 s / client IP, configurable

The health endpoints are **exempt from rate limiting** on purpose. A platform
probe polling every second would consume the budget, start receiving 429s, be
read as unhealthy and trigger a restart loop — a self-inflicted outage. Those
endpoints touch no database and return no data.

## Middleware order

Order is the design, not a preference:

1. trust proxy — before anything reads `req.ip`
2. request id — so every later log line and error can be correlated
3. request logging — early, so even a rejected request is recorded
4. security headers — before any response body exists
5. CORS — before the body is read, so preflight stays cheap
6. JSON body parsing (100 KB limit)
7. general rate limiting — after identity, before route work
8. API routes
9. API 404 — only reached when nothing matched
10. central error handler — last

## Graceful shutdown

On `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`:

1. readiness is marked unavailable, so a load balancer stops sending new work
   **before** the socket closes;
2. the HTTP server stops accepting connections and lets in-flight requests
   finish (bounded by a 10 s timeout);
3. registered dependency hooks run — **none in B1**, because there is no
   connection to close and faking one would report a database shutdown that
   never happened. B2 registers MongoDB here;
4. the process exits.

`startServer()` returns handles rather than calling `process.exit`, so tests
can start and stop a real server without terminating the runner. Signal wiring
lives in `installSignalHandlers()` and is not invoked on import.

## B1 limitations

Implemented here — and nothing more:

- no database connection, model or migration (B2)
- no `/api/v1/jobs` or job data (B3)
- no resume upload or private storage (B4)
- no application submission (B5)
- no transactional email (B6)
- no backend security, failure-handling or QA gate hardening (B7 — *Backend
  Security, Failure & QA Gate*; it is not the admin/authentication milestone)
- no Apply-specific rate limiter — it ships with the Apply endpoint in B5
- readiness reports 503 until B2, B4 and B6 land

`GET /api/v1/jobs` returns `404 API_ROUTE_NOT_FOUND`. The frontend's Careers
page therefore shows its error state against this backend, which is the honest
result.
